# Modelling-Simulation-and-Optimization

 A simulated model for a high-speed train that consists of train arrivals and departures from London Old Oak Common Station to Birmingham Interchange Station. This study aims to optimize the railway incident delay which causes major impact on the travel time of the Trains using SimPy and Monte-Carlo Optimization in Python.
